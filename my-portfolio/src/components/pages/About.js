            <p>I am a early junior web develoer from Houston,TX. It can get pretty hot here, which is the perfect excuse for me to stay home and work on my coding skills.</p>
            <p>Coding is new to me but I have always been one to push myself to learn something and to get good at it, as well as I have always had an interest on how the web and tech works.</p>
            <p>When I am not coding you can usually find me in my room watching Youtube or a Futbol game. I also enjoy sleeping and listening to music. I try to also attend as many Mls or Houston Astros Games as possible.</p>
            <p>Take it easy!</p>
